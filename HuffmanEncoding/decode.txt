hello, I'm Ganning.
I am a high school student that tries to lol.

I'm a high school junior at North Carolina's School of Science and Mathematics. Since discovering programming in 7th grade, coding has fascinated me with how simple, yet complex it is. In my free time, I like to create applications that have a positive impact on the lives of those around me. I've created Chrome extensions, mobile apps, websites for non-profits, and machine learning models. Currently, I'm working on an app that helps users track expiration dates for products!

In addition to computer science, business management and administration is a passion of mine. I love being able to lead teams and see projects through from start to finish, creating a quality product in a timely manner. In college, I plan on pursuing a double major of computer science and business management.
