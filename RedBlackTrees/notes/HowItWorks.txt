Red Black Tree: Self balancing binary search tree
- Every node is either RED or BLACK
- No more than one red node between two black nodes
- Every node at the bottom of a node that doens't contain data is a black null leaf (don't hold any data)
- Root node is always black
- Each branch has the same number of black nodes

Properties
- if the length of a branch is n, that branch can have at most n/2 red nodes
- the largest depth is red/black alternating nodes
- there will always be leaves (NULL nodes, because they are counted as black)

"between" the node and its grandparent (parent of the parent node)
