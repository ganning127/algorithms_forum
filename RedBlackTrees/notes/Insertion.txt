6 insertion cases

1. Node is Root (just change root node to BLACK)
2. Parent is BLACK (insert node as is RED)
3. Parent is RED & aunt is RED
    - recolor both to black
    - recolor Grandparent to RED
    - rebalance on Grandparent (do one of these 6 steps again)
4. Parent is RED & aunt is BLACK and node is inside child
5. Parent is RED and aunt is BLACK && node is outside child
